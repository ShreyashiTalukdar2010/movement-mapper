### A Pose Estimation AI Project Exploring Sattriya & Ballet Fusion

Movement Mapper is an experimental project that combines the grace of **Sattriya**, a classical Indian dance form, with the poise of **Western ballet**, using AI-powered **pose estimation** to compare, visualize, and celebrate movement across cultures.

This is my attempt to bring classical dance into the 21st century — by using technology not to replace tradition, but to **reinterpret and reimagine** it.

## Project Goals
-  Track and analyze key poses in Sattriya and ballet using AI
-  Use pose estimation (e.g., MediaPipe/OpenPose) to capture motion frames
-  Visualize posture similarities/differences through plots and skeletal overlays
-  Design a visual dance "dictionary" — where AI meets choreography

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- MediaPipe / OpenPose
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works

1. Record or source short dance clips (Sattriya + Ballet)
2. Run pose estimation AI to extract skeletal keypoints
3. Plot and analyze pose angles, balance, and geometry
4. Identify fusion opportunities — can Sattriya hand mudras work within ballet lines?
5. Visualize findings + narrate cultural fusion!

## Why This Matters

Movement is universal — yet shaped by culture.  
By mapping Sattriya and ballet together through AI, I’m exploring how tradition and technology can *collaborate*, not compete.  
This project is part of my ongoing research into **creative coding, movement intelligence, and intercultural choreography**.
